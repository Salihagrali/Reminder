Reminder
-A backend project to study and solidify my skills on Spring Security, JWT, Quartz and other areas of backend development.

What is it ?
-Reminder is a project to set up scheduled mails to remind the user later. It uses Quartz to schedule mails and Java Mail to actually send mail to the specified email.
Project has custom Spring Security architecture and JWT implementation. To reach out to the secured endpoints, first one should register as a user then should login to 
get the JWT token. This token must be used to reach out to the secured endpoints.

What did I learned by doing this project ?
-Most valuable lesson I got from this project is actually planning what to do beforehand. Initially I started off without security. Due to my lack of experience in the security, I couldn't connect the dots
to implement a whole secured system. I messed up entities such as UserEntity. Also created unnecessary entities. When I understood what my mistakes are, I was already deep in overall
implementation. Nevertheless, with reading docs and watching tutorials I overcome that problem.
